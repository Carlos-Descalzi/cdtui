# CDTUI

A very rustic component based UI library for terminal applications in python3
Mainly used for my own purposes, so is very limited in functionality and barely documented.

## Setup

    sudo python3 setup.py install
    or (for user only setup)
    python3 setup.py install --prefix=$HOME/.local
